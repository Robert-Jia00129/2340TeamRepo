      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        SwiftHire is a web-based recruiting platform designed to streamline the hiring process for both job seekers and recruiters. Built as a Georgia Tech student project, our platform addresses the common pain points in modern recruitment by providing intuitive tools that make finding, evaluating, and connecting with talent more efficient.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The platform serves two primary user groups: <strong>job seekers</strong> looking for their next opportunity, and <strong>recruiters</strong> seeking qualified candidates. We provide role-specific features including advanced search capabilities, location-based job discovery, application pipeline management, and integrated communication tools—all within a clean, responsive interface.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Our development follows Agile Scrum methodology across three sprints, prioritizing user-centered design principles and modern web technologies. The result is a pragmatic solution that reduces friction in the hiring process while maintaining the flexibility both candidates and recruiters need to make informed decisions.

            <p class="muted">
              Interactive map view allows job seekers to filter opportunities by distance from their current location. The map displays job postings as markers, with real-time distance calculations and filtering controls. Users can set radius preferences (5, 10, 25, 50 miles) and view commute estimates.

            <p class="muted">
              Comprehensive privacy settings panel where job seekers control their profile visibility. Users can toggle what information recruiters see (contact details, work history, skills, projects), set profile to private/public, and manage who can message them. Real-time preview shows how their profile appears to recruiters.

          <h3>🔄 Sprint Planning & Execution</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            We organized work into 3 sprints with clear goals. Each sprint began with planning sessions where we broke down user stories into actionable tasks. Daily standups kept the team aligned, and sprint reviews/retrospectives ensured continuous improvement.
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Sprint 1: Basic features including posting and applying for jobs</li>

          <h3>🎨 Design Patterns & Principles</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            <strong>Component-Based Architecture:</strong> Built reusable UI components (cards, modals, forms) for consistency across features. Each component follows single-responsibility principle.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            <strong>RESTful API Design:</strong> Clean separation between frontend and backend. Endpoints follow REST conventions (GET /jobs, POST /messages, etc.) with consistent JSON responses.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Distinct user roles (Job Seeker, Recruiter, Admin) with granular permissions. Middleware validates authorization for each request.

          <h3>📊 User Story Mapping</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            We used story mapping to visualize the user journey and prioritize features. High-level activities (Find Job, Apply, Communicate) were broken into user stories, then tasks. This helped us identify MVP scope and plan releases.
